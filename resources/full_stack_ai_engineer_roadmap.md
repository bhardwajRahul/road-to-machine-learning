# Full-Stack AI Engineer Blueprint (Beginner to Advanced)

This guide extends the ML journey in this repository with software engineering depth, so you can move from training models to shipping complete AI products.

Think of it as a practical "build and deploy" companion to the core ML roadmap.

**Naming note:** Topic labels such as **Module 01** in this blueprint are **steps inside this guide only**. They are **not** the same as this repository’s numbered folders (**`00-prerequisites` … `25-generative-ai-llms`**). When this file says “pair with core ML modules,” it always means those **repo** folders.

**In-repo lesson chapters:** Step-by-step chapters live under [`resources/full_stack_track/`](full_stack_track/README.md). Read the matching chapter for each phase, then return here for deliverables and external free links.

## Why This Blueprint

- **ML + Engineering Together**: Learn how model work connects to backend, frontend, and cloud systems
- **Beginner to Advanced**: Start from TypeScript fundamentals and grow into production architecture
- **Project First**: Each phase ends with a concrete deliverable you can add to your portfolio
- **Industry Ready**: Focus on authentication, reliability, testing, observability, and deployment

---

## How to Study This Path

1. Follow phases in order.
2. Build the deliverable at the end of each phase.
3. Pair this with core ML modules from the main roadmap.
4. Use AI assistants for speed, but keep core reasoning and debugging manual.

## Pairing with This Repository's ML Roadmap

For balanced growth, run both tracks:

- **ML depth**: Continue core modules in this repo (`00-15`, `19` as Stage 1.5, `20-21`, `25`)
- **Engineering depth**: Complete Phases A-H in this blueprint
- **Portfolio target**:
  - 2 ML-focused projects
  - 2 full-stack AI products
  - 1 deployment/operations case study

If you complete both tracks, you will not only train models, but also design and ship AI systems that real users can trust.
