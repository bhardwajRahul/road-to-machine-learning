# Project 5: Customer Segmentation

Segment customers into groups based on behavior and demographics.

**Starter code:** Run `starter.py` after placing the segmentation CSV in `data/`.

## Difficulty
Intermediate

## Time Estimate
3-4 days

## Skills You'll Practice
- Unsupervised Learning
- Clustering
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Data Visualization

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will learn to:
- Apply clustering algorithms
- Choose optimal number of clusters
- Interpret cluster results
- Use dimensionality reduction for visualization
- Extract business insights from clusters

## Dataset

**Mall Customer Segmentation**
- [Kaggle Mall Customer Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)
- Customer demographics and spending
- Features: Age, Income, Spending Score

## Project Steps

### Step 1: Load and Explore Data
- Load dataset
- Explore feature distributions
- Check for missing values
- Visualize relationships

### Step 2: Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values
- Scale features (important for clustering!)
- Feature selection
- Check for outliers

### Step 3: Dimensionality Reduction
- Apply PCA for visualization
- Use t-SNE for visualization
- Reduce dimensions if needed
- Visualize in 2D/3D

### Step 4: K-Means Clustering
- Determine optimal k (elbow method)
- Apply K-Means
- Analyze clusters
- Visualize clusters

### Step 5: Hierarchical Clustering
- Apply hierarchical clustering
- Create dendrogram
- Choose number of clusters
- Compare with K-Means

### Step 6: DBSCAN
- Apply DBSCAN
- Handle outliers
- Compare with other methods

### Step 7: Cluster Analysis
- Profile each cluster
- Identify cluster characteristics
- Business interpretation
- Actionable insights

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Jupyter Notebook** with clustering analysis
2. **Cluster Profiles** describing each segment
3. **Visualizations** of clusters
4. **Business Recommendations** based on segments

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Silhouette Score**: Cluster quality
- **Inertia**: Within-cluster sum of squares
- **Business Metrics**: Actionability of segments

## Clustering Methods to Try

1. **K-Means**: Most common, fast
2. **Hierarchical**: Tree-like structure
3. **DBSCAN**: Density-based, handles outliers
4. **Gaussian Mixture**: Probabilistic

## Tips

- Always scale features before clustering
- Use elbow method to find optimal k
- Visualize clusters in 2D/3D
- Interpret clusters for business
- Try multiple algorithms and compare
- Use silhouette score for evaluation
