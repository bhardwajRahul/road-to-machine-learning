# Project 3: Movie Recommendation System

Build a recommendation system to suggest movies to users.

**Starter code:** Run `starter.py` after downloading MovieLens data to `data/`.

## Difficulty
Intermediate

## Time Estimate
5-7 days

## Skills You'll Practice
- Collaborative Filtering
- Content-Based Filtering
- Matrix Factorization
- Recommendation Metrics

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will learn to:
- Implement collaborative filtering
- Build content-based recommendations
- Use matrix factorization
- Evaluate recommendation systems
- Handle cold-start problem

## Dataset

**MovieLens Dataset**
- [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
- User ratings for movies
- Movie metadata (genres, year, etc.)
- Start with 100K dataset

## Project Steps

### Step 1: Load and Explore Data
- Load ratings and movie data
- Analyze rating distribution
- Check for sparsity
- Explore user and movie statistics

### Step 2: Collaborative Filtering
- User-based collaborative filtering
- Item-based collaborative filtering
- Calculate similarity matrices
- Generate recommendations

### Step 3: Matrix Factorization
- Implement SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)
- Use scikit-surprise library
- Tune hyperparameters
- Generate recommendations

### Step 4: Content-Based Filtering
- Extract movie features (genres, etc.)
- Calculate similarity between movies
- Recommend similar movies
- Combine with collaborative filtering

### Step 5: Hybrid Approach
- Combine collaborative and content-based
- Weight different approaches
- Improve recommendation quality

### Step 6: Evaluation
- Split data into train/test
- Calculate RMSE, MAE
- Use precision@k, recall@k
- Evaluate on test set

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Jupyter Notebook** with all approaches
2. **Recommendation Function** that takes user ID and returns recommendations
3. **Evaluation Report** comparing different methods
4. **Demo** showing recommendations for sample users

## Evaluation Metrics

- **RMSE**: Root Mean Squared Error
- **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error
- **Precision@K**: Top-K precision
- **Recall@K**: Top-K recall
- **Diversity**: Variety of recommendations

## Approaches to Implement

1. **User-Based CF**: Find similar users
2. **Item-Based CF**: Find similar items
3. **Matrix Factorization**: SVD, NMF
4. **Content-Based**: Based on movie features
5. **Hybrid**: Combine multiple approaches

## Tips

- Start with simple collaborative filtering
- Use scikit-surprise for matrix factorization
- Handle cold-start problem (new users/movies)
- Consider popularity bias
- Evaluate on held-out test set

## Extensions

- Real-time recommendations
- Handle implicit feedback
- Deep learning approaches
- Deploy as web service
- Build web interface

## Next Steps

After completing this project:
- Try larger datasets (1M, 10M ratings)
- Experiment with deep learning
- Move to [Project 4: Fraud Detection](../project-04-fraud-detection/README.md)
