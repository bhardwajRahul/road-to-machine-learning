## What is Machine Learning?

### Definition

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.

**Simple Definition:** Learning from `data` to make predictions.

**Key Concept:** Instead of writing explicit rules, we let the computer learn patterns from examples.

### Traditional Programming vs Machine Learning

**Traditional Programming:**
```
Input Data + Rules/Program → Output
```

**Machine Learning:**
```
Input Data + Output → Rules/Model (learned)
Then: New Input Data → Model → Output
```

### Example Comparison

**Traditional Approach (Spam Detection):**
```python
# Hard-coded rules
def is_spam(email):
    if "free money" in email.lower():
        return True
    if "click here" in email.lower():
        return True
    # ... many more rules
    return False
```

**Machine Learning Approach:**
```python
# Learn from examples
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

# Train on labeled examples
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(training_emails, labels)  # Learn patterns

# Use learned model
prediction = model.predict(new_email)
```

### Why Machine Learning?

1. **Complex Problems**: Some problems are too complex for explicit rules
2. **Adaptability**: Models can adapt to new patterns
3. **Scalability**: Handle large amounts of data
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Find patterns humans might miss
5. **Automation**: Reduce manual work

### Machine Learning Applications

**Real-World Applications:**
- **Recommendation Systems**: Netflix, Amazon product recommendations
- **Fraud Detection**: Credit card fraud, insurance fraud
- **Spam Filter**: Email spam detection (Gmail, Outlook)
- **Self-driving Cars**: Autonomous vehicle navigation
- **Image Recognition**: Face recognition, object detection
- **Natural Language Processing**: Chatbots, translation
- **Medical Diagnosis**: Disease detection from medical images
- **Financial Trading**: Stock price prediction, algorithmic trading

### Machine Learning Workflow Summary

**Standard ML Workflow:**
```
Problem → Data → EDA → Features → Model → Evaluate → Improve
```

**Detailed Steps:**

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning

**Definition**: Learning from labeled data (input-output pairs).

**How it works:**
- Training data has both features (X) and labels (y)
- Model learns the mapping: X → y
- Makes predictions on new, unseen data

**Example:**
```python
# Training data
X_train = [[25], [30], [35], [40]]  # Features (age)
y_train = [50000, 60000, 70000, 80000]  # Labels (salary)

# Model learns: age → salary
# Then predicts salary for new age
```

**Two Main Types:**

#### A. Regression
- **Goal**: Predict continuous values
- **Examples**: 
  - House price prediction
  - Temperature forecasting
  - Stock price prediction
- **Output**: Real numbers

```python
# Example: Predicting house prices
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Features: size, bedrooms, location
# Target: price (continuous value)
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)  # y_train is continuous
predictions = model.predict(X_test)  # Predict prices
```

#### B. Classification
- **Goal**: Predict categories/classes
- **Examples**:
  - Spam email detection (spam/not spam)
  - Image classification (cat/dog)
  - Disease diagnosis (healthy/sick)
- **Output**: Categories

```python
# Example: Email spam detection
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Features: email content
# Target: spam (0) or not spam (1)
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)  # y_train is categories
predictions = model.predict(X_test)  # Predict spam/not spam
```

**Common Algorithms:**
- Linear Regression, Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees, Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Neural Networks

### 2. Unsupervised Learning

**Definition**: Learning from unlabeled data (only features, no labels).

**How it works:**
- Training data has only features (X), no labels
- Model finds patterns, structures, or relationships
- Discovers hidden patterns in data

**Example:**
```python
# Training data (no labels!)
X_train = [[25, 50000], [30, 60000], [35, 70000], [40, 80000]]
# No y_train - we don't know the groups

# Model discovers patterns/groups
```

**Main Types:**

#### A. Clustering
- **Goal**: Group similar data points
- **Examples**:
  - Customer segmentation
  - Image compression
  - Anomaly detection
- **Output**: Groups/clusters

```python
# Example: Customer segmentation
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Features: purchase history, demographics
# No labels - discover customer groups
model = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
clusters = model.fit_predict(X)  # Assign customers to groups
```

#### B. Dimensionality Reduction
- **Goal**: Reduce number of features while keeping important information
- **Examples**:
  - Data visualization (reduce to 2D/3D)
  - Feature selection
  - Noise reduction
- **Output**: Reduced feature space

```python
# Example: Reduce 100 features to 2 for visualization
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Original: 1000 samples, 100 features
# Reduced: 1000 samples, 2 features (for plotting)
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_reduced = pca.fit_transform(X)
```

**Common Algorithms:**
- K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering
- DBSCAN
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- t-SNE

### 3. Reinforcement Learning

**Definition**: Learning through interaction with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties.

**How it works:**
- Agent takes actions in an environment
- Receives rewards or penalties
- Learns optimal strategy to maximize rewards
- No labeled data - learns from experience

**Example:**
```python
# Game playing AI
# Agent: AI player
# Environment: Game board
# Actions: Move pieces
# Rewards: Win (+1), Lose (-1), Draw (0)

# Agent learns: which moves lead to wins
```

**Key Components:**
- **Agent**: The learner/decision maker
- **Environment**: The world the agent interacts with
- **Actions**: What the agent can do
- **Rewards**: Feedback from environment
- **Policy**: Strategy for choosing actions

**Applications:**
- Game playing (Chess, Go, video games)
- Robotics
- Autonomous vehicles
- Recommendation systems
- Trading algorithms

**Note**: Reinforcement Learning is advanced and typically covered after supervised/unsupervised learning.

### Comparison Table

| Type | Data | Goal | Example |
|------|------|------|---------|
| **Supervised** | Labeled (X, y) | Learn mapping X→y | Predict house price |
| **Unsupervised** | Unlabeled (X only) | Find patterns | Customer groups |
| **Reinforcement** | Experience | Maximize rewards | Game playing |

### Training settings and learner families

These labels show up in courses and papers; they are **orthogonal** to supervised vs unsupervised (they describe *how* training runs and *what* is stored).

**Batch vs online (incremental) learning**

- **Batch / offline**: The model sees a large (or full) dataset each update, or you train on fixed snapshots. Most sklearn examples are batch: `fit(X, y)` on a matrix you already hold.
- **Online / streaming / incremental**: New labeled rows arrive over time; you update the model in small steps without reloading everything. Useful for feeds, sensors, and fraud—often paired with careful drift monitoring (later: MLOps modules).

**Instance-based vs model-based**

- **Instance-based** learners memorize training examples (or a subset) and decide by *similarity at prediction time* (classic: **k-NN**). More data at serving time can mean more storage and slower queries.
- **Model-based** learners compress the data into parameters (weights, tree rules, etc.): **linear models, forests, neural nets**. Prediction is usually fast once parameters are fixed.

You will meet both families again when you choose metrics, validation splits, and deployment constraints.

## Machine Learning Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Problem Definition

**Questions to ask:**
- What problem are we solving?
- What is the business goal?
- What would success look like?
- What data do we need?

**Example:**
```
Problem: Predict customer churn
Goal: Identify customers likely to cancel subscription
Success: Reduce churn by 20%
Data needed: Customer behavior, demographics, usage patterns
```

#### 2. Data Collection

**Sources:**
- Databases
- APIs
- Web scraping
- Surveys
- Public datasets (Kaggle, UCI)

**Considerations:**
- Is data available?
- Is data sufficient?
- Is data representative?
- Privacy and ethics

#### 3. Data Preparation

**Tasks:**
- Load data
- Explore data (EDA)
- Handle missing values
- Handle outliers
- Encode categorical variables
- Scale/normalize features

**Example:**
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, LabelEncoder

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Handle missing values
df = df.fillna(df.mean())

# Encode categorical
le = LabelEncoder()
df['category'] = le.fit_transform(df['category'])

# Scale features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```

#### 4. Feature Engineering

**Creating meaningful features:**
- Combine features
- Create polynomial features
- Extract date features
- Domain-specific features

**Example:**
```python
# Create new features
df['total_spent'] = df['quantity'] * df['price']
df['age_group'] = pd.cut(df['age'], bins=[0, 25, 50, 75, 100])
df['days_since_signup'] = (today - df['signup_date']).days
```

#### 5. Model Selection

**Choose algorithm based on:**
- Problem type (regression/classification)
- Data size
- Interpretability needs
- Performance requirements

**Example:**
```python
# For small dataset, need interpretability
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=5)

# For large dataset, need performance
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
```

#### 6. Training

**Process:**
- Split data (train/validation/test)
- Train model on training data
- Validate on validation set
- Tune hyperparameters

**Example:**
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Train model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Validate
val_score = model.score(X_val, y_val)
```

#### 7. Evaluation

**Metrics:**
- **Regression**: MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²
- **Classification**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

**Example:**
```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

#### 8. Deployment

**Options:**
- REST API (Flask/FastAPI)
- Web application
- Mobile app
- Batch processing

**Example:**
```python
# Simple API
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.json
    prediction = model.predict([data['features']])
    return jsonify({'prediction': prediction[0]})
```

#### 9. Monitoring

**Track:**
- Model performance over time
- Data drift
- Prediction quality
- System performance

## Descriptive statistics and sampling foundations

These ideas show up in **every** ML project: you summarize data you have (a **sample**) and hope it reflects the **population** you care about.

### Mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

scores = np.array([72, 85, 90, 68, 88, 91, 77, 84])

print("mean:", scores.mean())
print("median:", np.median(scores))
# mode for continuous data is less common; for discrete counts use pandas
s = pd.Series([2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4])
print("mode:", s.mode().tolist())
print("variance (sample):", scores.var(ddof=1))   # unbiased sample variance
print("std (sample):", scores.std(ddof=1))

# Percentiles / quartiles (distribution shape)
print("25th, 50th, 75th:", np.percentile(scores, [25, 50, 75]))
```

### Population vs sample (intuition + simulation)

- **Population**: all units you *could* measure (often unknown or infinite).
- **Sample**: the subset you *actually* collected and train on.

```python
rng = np.random.default_rng(42)
# True population: normal with mean 100, std 15 (toy example)
population = rng.normal(100, 15, size=100_000)

# One random sample of 200 people
sample = rng.choice(population, size=200, replace=False)
print("Population mean (known in simulation):", population.mean())
print("Sample mean:", sample.mean())
# Sample mean changes each draw; larger samples usually get closer to population mean.
```

### Data types in ML (quick reference)

| Kind | Examples | Typical use |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Numeric continuous | height, price | regression targets, features |
| Numeric discrete | count of clicks | regression or classification features |
| Categorical nominal | country code | encoding then models |
| Categorical ordinal | survey Likert scale | ordered encoding |
| Text | email body | NLP pipelines |
| Time | timestamps | time-series features |

## Key Concepts

### Training Data vs Testing Data

**Training Data:**
- Used to teach the model
- Model learns patterns from this
- Typically 70-80% of data

**Testing Data:**
- Used to evaluate model
- Model has never seen this
- Typically 20-30% of data
- Simulates real-world performance

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split: 80% train, 20% test
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Train on training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate on test data (unseen!)
score = model.score(X_test, y_test)
```

### Features and Labels

**Features (X):**
- Input variables
- What the model uses to make predictions
- Also called: predictors, independent variables

**Labels/Targets (y):**
- Output variable
- What we want to predict
- Also called: target, dependent variable

**Example:**
```python
# Features (X): age, income, education
# Label (y): loan_approved (yes/no)

X = df[['age', 'income', 'education']]
y = df['loan_approved']
```

### Overfitting vs Underfitting

**Overfitting:**
- Model memorizes training data
- Performs well on training, poorly on test
- Too complex model
- **Solution**: Simplify model, more data, regularization

```python
# Overfitting example
# Training accuracy: 99%
# Test accuracy: 60%
# Gap indicates overfitting!
```

**Underfitting:**
- Model too simple
- Can't capture patterns
- Poor performance on both train and test
- **Solution**: More complex model, better features

```python
# Underfitting example
# Training accuracy: 55%
# Test accuracy: 53%
# Both low - model too simple!
```

**Good Fit:**
```python
# Good fit example
# Training accuracy: 85%
# Test accuracy: 83%
# Close performance - good generalization!
```

### Bias-Variance Tradeoff

**Bias:**
- Error from overly simplistic assumptions
- High bias = underfitting

**Variance:**
- Error from sensitivity to small fluctuations
- High variance = overfitting

**Tradeoff:**
- Can't minimize both simultaneously
- Need to find balance
